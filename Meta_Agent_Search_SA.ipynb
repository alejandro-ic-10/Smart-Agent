       " 'Tesla shares soared 22% to close at $260.48 on Thursday, the stock’s best day since 2013, following the company’s better-than-expected earnings report.\\n\\nThe company late Wednesday reported revenue of $25.18 billion, which came in just under analysts’ expectations of $25.37 billion, but was up 8% compared with a year earlier. Tesla reported earnings per share of 72 cents adjusted, topping the average analyst estimate of 58 cents.\\n\\n“We expect this surprising earnings beat to power a strong positive reaction in Tesla shares Thursday, given the degree to which investors have become conditioned to earnings misses from the company,” analysts at JPMorgan wrote in a note.\\n\\nTesla’s profit margins in the third quarter were boosted by $739 million in revenue for environmental regulatory credits, which the JPMorgan analysts noted were a “potentially unsustainable driver” of earnings and cash flow.\\n\\nAutomakers are required to obtain a certain amount of regulatory credits every year, and if they can’t meet the target, they can buy credits from other companies. Tesla has excess credits because it only makes electric vehicles.\\n\\nTesla earnings also got a boost from FSD, the company’s Full Self-Driving Supervised system. CFO Vaibhav Taneja said on the earnings call that FSD contributed $326 million in revenue in the quarter after Tesla made it available for use in the Cybertruck and added a feature called “Actually Smart Summon.”\\n\\nCEO Elon Musk said on the call that his “best guess” is that “vehicle growth” will reach 20% to 30% next year, citing “lower cost vehicles” and the “advent of autonomy.” Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting delivery growth of about 15% for 2025.\\n\\nEven bullish Deutsche Bank analysts doubted Musk’s forecast and wrote, in a note following the earnings report, “Our view remains more reserved at 10-15% (~2.03m),” and assumes Tesla can roll out a cheaper version of its Model Y at a price under $30,000 after subsidies, and other variants of the small SUV.\\n\\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley who also recommend buying the stock, called Musk’s 2025 vehicle delivery growth prediction a “maybe.” They set their estimate at 14%.\\n\\nIt “clearly depends on the company’s ability to improve affordability through cheaper model (next gen) introduction, financing offers and improved features,” the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note Thursday.\\n\\nA grain of salt\\n\\nMusk said on the Wednesday call that Tesla plans to start production of its recently unveiled Cybercab, a robotaxi with butterfly doors and no steering wheel or pedals, by the end of 2026. He also said Tesla would conduct driverless ridehailing in California and Texas next year in its existing cars, which are not currently safe to use without a human driver ready to steer or brake at any time.\\n\\nBernstein analysts, who have a bearish price target of $120 on shares of Tesla, wrote in a note out Thursday: “The tone of Tesla’s conference call was ebullient and filled with Musk prognostications that have historically polarized bull and bear investors, and was more akin to a pep rally, with the company only taking two questions from sell-siders.”\\n\\nMusk has for years promised shareholders a software upgrade that can turn Teslas into robotaxis. That hasn’t happened yet. Musk has also promised a refreshed version of the Tesla Roadster since 2017. The design of the vehicle is not yet complete. \\n\\nThe Bernstein analysts wrote, “We continue to struggle to see Tesla overcoming the technological and regulatory hurdles needed to leapfrog current level 4 robotaxis, and believe fully unsupervised FSD could be years away.”\\n\\nThey pointed to Musk’s “long history of being overly optimistic about FSD” and said crowdsourced research that shows “Tesla continues to lag well behind competitors” on robotaxis.\\n\\nThe share rally Thursday was the sharpest since a 24% gain in May 2013. The jump erased Tesla’s loss for the year and left the stock up 3% in 2024, though it still trails the 22% gain for the Nasdaq.\\n\\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/24/tesla-shares-surge-as-analysts-react-to-q3-earnings-musk-predictions.html',\n",
       " 'Tesla’s stock price depends on it “not being a car company”. Usually people have pointed to it being an “energy” company or an “AI” company where the market potential in either sector is huge. The problem is I don’t have any evidence of anyone else at the company aside from Elon driving this vision. Ever since Tesla almost went bankrupt my impression is the company is largely built around reacting to Elon’s direction, which was fine when Elon was largely focusing on Tesla. However it seems quite clear that Elon, who is a very “mission” driven individual, has other missions such as “protect free speech”, “destroy the work mind virus”, and “extend humanity beyond Earth” that are much more important and interesting to him than dominate the energy sector. AI is also interesting to him, though it’s not quite clear to what end, and in theory that should bode well for Tesla as he previously touted Tesla as having amazing AI capabilities because of FSD. However more and more it seems that he’s putting his AI initiatives beyond FSD in xAI. To the extent that I was surprised when he was previously polling on X whether Tesla should invest I think it was 5B in xAI at what I imagine would be an unreasonable valuation at probably a minority ownership. Why is he doing this? Why didn’t he put xAI under Tesla from the beginning? The reason is control. At this point in Elon’s life he doesn’t want to spend much time on something he can’t fully control, and with Tesla as a listed company it will always be both 1) at risk of loss of control  and 2) just in general annoying to administer - even if he has control there will always be more hoops to jump through, which he hates, compared to a private company.\\n\\nSo what is Tesla now to Elon? It’s his cash cow to fund his other initiatives. And without him focusing on Tesla, and without other competent leadership at the company to drive these ambitious initiatives, all of these ambitious projects that are still a long way from completion, will be more akin to ambitious projects at Google. Robotaxis looks more like Google Glass than Starlink.\\n\\nSo that’s it, I think Tesla will chug along and Elon will involve in Tesla mainly to the extent of reacting to keeping the stock price reasonable. Currently the price is inflated based on people going “he did XYZ at other companies so don’t underestimate him on Tesla”. But for the reasons I mentioned above despite Elon’s successes elsewhere it’s not going to happen at Tesla.\\n\\nWould love to hear what others think.',\n",
       " 'Hello, everyone! As we all know, $TSLA is having their quarterly earnings, which is a big deal for some bears. But let’s crack down on the bear party just for a second and use *logical* reasoning for why TSLA might not end up in the gutter as many would think. \\n\\n1. Expectations are low, just like Q1 (will get back to this later).\\n2. Their shittiness is priced in already after Robotaxi event.\\n3. Elon Musk is a master stock manipulator. \\n\\nKeeping all of this in mind, this isn’t even the *real* part of this DD. The actual, most integral part is looking at Elon Musk’s Twitter, which I decided to keep a close look on the past couple of earnings reports. \\n\\nOn the day of Tesla’s Q1, Elon Musk tweeted a total of 5 times, where the stock ended up going up 13% and then an additional 16% the next 2 weeks. \\n\\nOn the day of Tesla Q2, Elon Musk didn’t tweet **anything**, and the stock ended up falling 14%. \\n\\nSeems like a pattern has been drawn up, huh? Elon tweets a bit when the Tesla stock is going to moon on earnings while he’s in a cocky mood, and is dead silent when Tesla is going to fall. \\n\\nNow guess how many times Elon Musk has tweeted *so far* today? \\n\\n*15 fucking times*. \\n\\nYou heard that right, folks! 15 GODDAMN times. That’s triple the amount of tweets he had made on Q1, where the stock roared 13 - 15%! Meaning that Elon is much more confidence and cockier than he was in Q1! This man knows when his stock will fall and when it doesn’t, and he’s letting us know right below our own nose! \\n\\nAll of this is a *clear* indicator that Tesla is going to the moon today and the next week to come, regardless of whether they beat estimates or not. I’m betting that Tesla WILL beat estimates simply because of Elon Musk’s tweets and the fact that everyone has low confidence in the stock as of late. \\n\\nThis is your DD to buy calls. Whether you want free money or not is up to you. \\n\\nPositions: 15 minutes before market close, I’ll buy 3 217.5C exp. OCT. 25th. \\n\\n*note*: This is NOT financial advice. Any losses on $TSLA options deep OOTM is a result of your regardedness, not mine. ',\n",
       " \"Genuine question to the people that hold Tesla stock for the long term or are currently buying the dip. What will be the final straw that causes you to sell the stock? The fundamentals of the company are degrading, yet the stock price isn't really going down that much. This means that people aren't really selling. The stock trades at a forward PE of about 60, probably higher if current estimates are too high, which they likely are. The growth of the company is stalling and the company is desperately trying to drop prices and do all sorts of other things to sell cars. Elon is a loose canon and while in the past that was a good thing, it now seems like more of a liability than at anything. The stock trades at a rich valuation because people expect a bright future ahead, but what will cause you to change your mind about Tesla's future and sell the stock? Elon has promised quite a lot and you probably believe him, but he has a bad record of overpromising, so what, if anything, will cause you stop believing in what he says? \\n\\nI hold no positions in Tesla but have a bearish view because I think their valuation is too high.\",\n",

He told Yahoo Finance in a recent interview that his investment fund still had a $50 million stake in the company.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Over time, I\\'ve just been sort of lowering my position, because I just don\\'t have the same confidence that they\\'re going to achieve the goals that were set out for Tesla several years ago and even recently, which is really to sell more cars,\" Gerber said, dismissing bullish talk on Tesla\\'s robotics and full-self-driving tech. \"That\\'s just a distraction from the fact that they need to sell cars, this year, and next year, and the year after, because none of this is coming anytime soon,\" he added.\\n\\n\\n\\nOther Tesla investors have also grown skeptical and impatient over the car company\\'s trajectory. Tesla\\'s stock is down 13% this year, largely because of declining sales, rising competition in China, and drama surrounding Musk\\'s legal battles.\\n\\n\\n\\nGerber said the used-car market was swarmed with old Teslas, adding that he\\'d been unable to offload his own Tesla at what he deemed a fair value.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s really a quagmire where you have the best products in an industry but a CEO who doesn\\'t actually work there, who doesn\\'t try to sell the cars,\" Gerber said, adding: \"We\\'ve seen sales go down, and that\\'s what\\'s happening. Sales are going down. If you\\'re expecting a great quarter, you\\'re wrong. They\\'re not selling any Teslas here, other than basically, discount, discount, discount.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd while analysts have made the case that the company is being undervalued as an AI firm, Gerber said artificial intelligence was unlikely to save the company. He speculated that demand would be poor for Tesla\\'s humanoid robots, given doubts over Musk amid his chaotic revamp of Twitter into X.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The simplest way to do it is, go around to your neighbors and ask them, \\'How many of you would buy a humanoid robot built by Elon Musk?\\' And the answer is zero, OK. Nobody wants a robot from Elon Musk. Why? Who would trust it?\" Gerber said, adding: \"The last thing I need is some robot built by Elon Musk in my house, so I don\\'t know if they thought about the marketing of this at all yet.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nMusk\\'s leadership of Tesla has been under rising scrutiny from investors and lawmakers over the past few years.

       " 'Hi Reddit!\\n\\nI\\'ve (30M) been stressed about my father\\'s retirement savings ever since he told me he converted his entire savings from a normal target date fund to 100% Tesla stock. This occurred in 2020 around the same timeframe of the first stock split, and all contributions to date have been Tesla.\\n\\nFor background both my dad and I have loved the company and their products for years, but we differ in that I think the stock is heavily overpriced, and he has latched on to the valuations and extremely bullish forecasts people like Kathy Woods assign to Tesla. He\\'s convinced the stock is going to rocket to 4 - 10X its current value before he retires, and hasn\\'t really reacted to the bearish arguments I\\'ve laid out acknowledging how much more expensive the company is than every other automaker and how competition is increasing in the space. Not to mention that much of its valuation is currently highly speculative such as \"robo-taxis\" while their FSD is starting to fall behind competitors in execution and is still not (and may never be) fully delivered.\\n\\nSetting the valuation of Tesla debate aside, I would never advise any person at any age to put 100% of their retirement portfolio in any single stock, let alone one as risky as Tesla. I\\'ve tried explaining the extreme risk in a zero diversity portfolio, where if this single company goes under he loses his entire retirement fund (\"all your eggs are in one basket\"), but he doesn\\'t seem to take it seriously.\\n\\nMy fear is that he is already behind on where he probably should be in his retirement savings. He\\'s told me before he spoke with a financial advisor before doing this, and he didn\\'t have enough funds to manage with them. I feel he is making this gamble as he thinks its the only way to catch up, not recognizing he could also lose it all. I know he has not talked to any advisors since about his current investment strategy.\\n\\nSome questions I\\'m hoping you can help answer for him and I, so he has an outside perspective:\\n\\nIf you are neutral or bearish on Tesla, how would you explain the issues and risks with its va;ue going forward?\\n\\nIf you are bullish on Tesla, are you investing 100% of your savings in it, and would you advise a 58-year-old to do the same with their retirement savings? Why or why not?\\n\\nHow would you explain the risk of his current plan to him, and what alternatives would you suggest?\\n\\nWhat should an ideal retirement portfolio look like for someone his age?\\n\\nWhat resources do you believe would be good to share with him that might help reopen the conversation on reducing his risk and impressing the importance of diversification?\\n\\nIt\\'s not an easy conversation to have with a parent, and ultimately I respect that he\\'s an adult who can do what he wants with his money. I\\'ve tried a few times to have it but its difficult to balance not being taken as condescending to your own father while explaining how insanely risky you think his financial decisions are. It\\'s made it more difficult by the high upturns TSLA has taken in stretches, validating all his beliefs, but with the subsequent downturns he\\'s doubled down and not acknowledged the volatility and risk. I fear with him consuming positive bullish Tesla content exclusively, he is not considering bearish outcomes or basic retirement savings advice. Any feedback from the community that can offer an alternative view would be highly appreciated, as I hope I can share some of your resources and opinions with him next time I retry this conversation.\\n\\nThanks so much!  \\n\\n\\nEDIT: For those asking, I believe he got in at late August 2020 timeframe, around what is now the $120 - $140 price range.  He has averaged up basically ever since, so not clear on what the current average price is.  I think he is up now on original investment, but down on most continued contributions.',\n",

Borrowing costs and reported short interest is higher than Tesla at the time of their stock split, and DD supports GME has *extensive* hidden short positions, likely in the hundreds of ~~thousands~~ millions, that are going to be hit hard with this stock split in the form of a stock dividend.\\n\\n*Opinion:*  It may take some time yet, but with this strategic decision to announce a stock split in the form of a stock dividend, and combining it with the launch of their MarketPlace - GME appears to be positioned for *significant price appreciation over the remainder of this year!!*  \\\\[Note:  As GME truly presents a systemic risk to the markets, be prepared for continued manipulation.  This may still take a while.\\\\]\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Buy, HODL, DRS & \\'Share the Story\\'**\\n\\n>**To the moon fellow apes!**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n    DISCLAIMER ** Information contained in this post has been compiled from sources believed to be reliable.

Most lenders tend to recall shares to ensure they receive the dividend so that they have the shares to credit to their client accounts.  However borrowers no longer have the ***20+ million shares*** they borrowed to short $GME down.  As borrowers / shorts attempt to buy the shares back to close their short positions, they have a very small pool of liquid shares to buy from - resulting in price appreciation:\\n\\nShares outstanding are 76,347,215, less insiders 11.807,433, less DRS 12,700,00 = 51.839,782 free float. Reduced by *less liquid* shares (may not be able to sell in the near term):  Institutional: 13,716,541, Mutual Funds: 7,957,066, ETFs: 6,690,476.  \\\\[Note there is uncertainty about some overlap in Institutional shares and mutual funds and ETFS\\\\].  **This represents a remaining** ***liquid*** **float of only approximately 23,4 million shares for the shorts to buy shares from to close their borrowed** ***and*** **naked/counterfeit/synthetic positions.**\\n\\nAnd We\\'re Not Selling.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;',\n",
